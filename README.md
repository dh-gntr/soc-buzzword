I am working in the backend team of the project.
I have installed nodejs and vs code.
Understood the basics of node from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEHCfRWz-EI&list=PLsyeobzWxl7occsESx2X1E2R2Uw5wCoeG .
Followed a video tutorial on building and understanding rest APIs from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48&t=2337s .
Will continue further work after midsems.
